do input
do movement interp

run scene specific logic (input is done, and nodes are where they should be accoridng to interp)
render out from root node


should un movable nodes be stored? ....
for my style of gui maybe....
how do I get the Ids?
how do i communcate from "id # is active" to was THIS button pressed?
do I store the ids as variables? maybe... its what i do for root nodes....
this is only important for one-to-one logic...
i could waste a tag (start game button) and check for it...
i only get 31 TAGs with a since variable mask tho...

PLAYERCARD
DIE
EVENTCARD
PLAYERCARDSLOT
DIESLOT
....

do i need an event / message system?
keep it in mind

consider a touch to start screen....


I should be able to animate screen transitions.... since the root controls all children
