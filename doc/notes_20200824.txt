i need a reliable way to go from node to gamestate value
right now I drive the node state from the game state values (but only kind of)
the card art is hardcoded to a test value, I need a way to lookup the real value...
... for both tooltips and for gameplay logic also
currently i figure out which index a card node is and relate that back to an index in the gamestate
that might get out of hand for dealing with the dice, cards, events, and in play cards...
if i store the indexes in a lookup map... i need to keep it in sync, but it would speed up the data lookup...
i could jam it into an int...
used the first x bits to flag what game data it is, then use the remaining to store an index....
or i could store it in 2 ints, 1 for an enum, and for index...
previously i used an event system to signal what card was being played / discarded... but those cards stored an internal ref to what they were....

Need some sort of timing method...

Gameplay loop

Gain energy
  Loop through dice
Draw a card
Draw an event

Play Cards and Energy
Most win conditions require a minimum signal strength

Discard down to __ cards
Destroy event in final slot
Cosume: 1 Food, 1 Water, 1 O2
  If cannot: lose
