Puzzle/logic type game mechanics
- Zachtronic style solve a problem with tools and logic
  - Many solutions, player judged on quality of solutions
  - Tools need some cost metric to measure
  - time to complete usually a metric
  - some other 3rd relevant metric (size, operation performed, etc)

- sokoban style puzzles
  - move blocks and interact with mechanisms to achieve an end state goal

- factory builing games
  - similar to zachtronic style games...
  - may have more open ended goals/changing goals

- "programming" games
  - human resource machine / 7 billion humans
  - teach people programming / logic concept by abstract the ideas away from computing / code

- Pipe dream / connector games
  - player uses tiles or rules to make a start and end node connector
  - usually fighting a timer

- match 3 games
  - more about pattern regonition and move planning
  - usually fighting a timer

Trying to avoid key and door mechanics, they just add steps to a game most times without adding anything important (make a linear game look less linear at first glance)

I like the idea of letting the player come up with their own solution rather than having a single solution

this means I am probably looking for more of a "give player rules and components to solve a problem" game

I need to be able to create unique challeges for the players to solve so they arent just solving the same problem again and again
  - TIS did this by limiting nodes available, by number, type, and arrangement; as well as requiring specific outputs
  - Magnus did this by having different molecule shape goals and starting components for each problem
  - Basically they were able to control inputs and outputs, but gave the player all tools and lots of space to come up with various solutions.

If I want to replicate this I need a game with multiple inputs I control, and varying outputs that I require and a sandbox gamepley experience so the player can experiment with the tools...

Objective is to remain 'not found'?
really want to avoid single solution puzzles / paths
