JS13k Template by David Brad
---

A collection of scripts, files, and boilerplates to ease the startup process of starting js13k.
- WebGL render already included.
- Asset and texture loading included.
- Basic gameloop.
- Built in fps / ms counters in debug build.
- Focused around an automated build system using Gulp, yarn package commands, and VSCodes task system.
- Automatic inlining everything by the spritesheet, and automatic zipping and size checking.
